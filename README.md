## ðŸ’»ðŸŽ® About The Project

Hi! This is my pet project, a 3D DirectX Game Engine. A month ago i started developing a game, but i came to an issue, Godot didn't provide me low-level renderer control, but i needed it.
Actually i could rewrite godot, as it's open-sourse, but i choice a more interesting way of solving the problem, making my own Game Engine :).

## ðŸ““ðŸ“‘ Progress
