## ðŸ’»ðŸŽ® About The Project

Hi! This is my pet project, a 3D DirectX Game Engine. I was working on this project a long time ago and did'nt finish it,
the purpose of it was learning DirectX and studying how game engines work. However it already has input processing,
update game loop, start and exit game methods, and the error handling implemented, so maybe anyone will consider it useful and
use it for personal projects.

## ðŸ““ðŸ“‘ Progress

- [x] Rendering a basic, empty window;
- [x] A nice Input system with Keyboard and Mouse support;
- [x] An exception handler for debugging
- [x] A beautiful Game Class, with Update GameLoop, start and exit method;
